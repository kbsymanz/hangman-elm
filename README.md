# Another Hangman Game in Elm

This is a simple hangman game with three sub-components and an extensible
record design. Each sub-component can run stand-alone via it's Main.elm module
for development purposes. The top-level Main.elm incorporates all of the
sub-components.

Runs in `elm-reactor`. Choose `src` -> `Main.elm`.

The phrases that are used are my own, randomly selected at runtime, and are
pretty lame.
